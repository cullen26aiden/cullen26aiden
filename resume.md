EXPERIENCE
Highlands Original Car Wash - Wash Attendant
October  2023 - September 2024
My time working here gave me more first world experience with problem solving than I'd ever had before. My manager would often leave me to run the place until close, allowing me to see the full scope of what managing a business entails. This job taught me interpersonal communication skills as well, as I would often have to guide customers through putting their tires on the conveyor belt safely. Learning problem-solving skills mostly arose through dealing with machine errors. These experiences taught me to remain level-headed through adversity and gave me the ability to look at major problems and figure out where to start resolving them.
EDUCATION
Atherton High School, Louisville KY - Honors Graduate
August  2021 - May 2025
I graduated with a 3.5 GPA and received several honors for my participation in volunteer organizations. I was also a member of the Atherton choir and received the highest honors as a group in KMEA assessment.
Northeastern University - Undergraduate Student
September 2025 - May 2029
My experience as a computer science major gives me the tools to understand how to work efficiently and creatively to problem solve in any given situation. I've also become a member of Northeastern's Live Music Association to become involved around campus and learn how to break down large scale tasks, like performing a concert, into manageable steps.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Keneseth Israel Preschool (2021-2025)
I volunteered at a pre-elementary school helping children learn how to read throughout my entire time in high school. The time I spent with the students was invaluable
